# Unit tests #

* Test one unit of code (a function or method) in something approaching
  isolation.

* Fast, focused (useful failures).

* Help you structure your code better.

<!SLIDE incremental>

# Integration tests #

* Test that the whole integrated system works; catch regressions.

* Slow.

* Less useful failures.

* Write fewer.

.notes Summary: both are useful, write more unit tests.
